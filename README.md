# Prediction_Assignment

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. The data used in this project are from the Groupware @ LES research group related to the HAR - Human Activity Recognition project. Groupware @ LES http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/ HAR http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/harlingweight_lifting_exercises We used the Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset which presents data about “six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to The front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E). Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. Participants were supervised by an experienced weight lifter to make sure the execution complied with the manner they were supposed to simulate.”

The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.
